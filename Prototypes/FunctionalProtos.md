# Functional Prototypes Info
The following link will take you to the functional prototypes for Duo Tech.
These were created using Adobe XD and were based on our paper prototypes. They are
hosted on web.engr.oregonstate.edu. Note that the organization of our application changed
since these prototypes were developed.

The prototypes can be found [here](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~garciros/FullProto/#/)
